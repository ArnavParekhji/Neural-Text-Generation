# Neural-Text-Generation
A neural text generation model using LSTMs to generate text trained on The Republic by Plato

Steps to run:
1. Dataset download link: http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1497/pg1497.txt or use republic.txt file
2. Run preprocess.py to use clean text and generate sequences of the text
3. Run create_and_train_model.py to train the neural network
4. Run gen_text.py to generate text based on an input seed text
